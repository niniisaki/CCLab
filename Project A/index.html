                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Florpians are not sociable creatures, a young Florp stays with their parents up until age 6, but until then they are taught how to survive, culture, 
                    and culture by their parents. 
                    Though Florpians tend to have strong loving emotions towards family members, they tend to leave their familes in hopes to find their soulmate.
                    But they prefer to stay in solitude while searching for their mate.

                <p>Florpians are born in darkness, they prefer empty spaces. They live in the world between the void and deep ocean.
                     Not much is know about their habitat. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Florpians main characteristics is actually their eyes and ears. Their eyes are gigantic and far apart creating a cute but humourous Appearance.
                    Their ears, are actually antennae, used to communicate with their own kind as well as others, but they tend to vary in appearances. Most Florpians 
                can only change up to two colors in their lifespan, but this specific Florp appears to have the ability to change to many colors.</p>

                Florpians are theorized to be a creature that is a cross between oceanic and alien-like. Like stated earlier, Florpians branch off from
                their parents around the age of 6 after learning survival skills, but many scientist have hypothesized that they are able to keep 
                in contact with their family through their antennae. Florpians come in a range of personality types, this one specifically tends to 
                be very mischievous, but they all share one instinct, the search for their soulmate, they yearn for their soulmate dearly until they are able to come 
                across their beloved. 
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> When handling a creature of this caliber you
                must never let your guard down. They can disappear and reappear in random parts of their makeshift habitat, this usually happens due 
                to their extraordinary telpathic powers which can hypnotize people to forget about their existence, when this happens it almost feels
                like time had briefly reset.(Refresh the sketch) If you tap around them or their habitat, they tend to change colors, its Current \
                purpose is unknown as of right now. However we have noticed that Florpians tend to pay attention to one of our devices, the button, 
                when moved Florpians tend to go in circles.
